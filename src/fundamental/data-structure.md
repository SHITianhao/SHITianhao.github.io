# Data Structure

### Arrays

Implement an automatically resizing array.

Once the array is full, an increased array will be allocted and fill with previous one. So that the complexity of ```add``` in array is not **O(1)** but ***O(1) amortized**.

### Linked Lists

Elements are connected with pointer. The previous element includes a pointer that points to the next element's address.

### Stack

Implementation of Last in First out, including two operations:

* Push: add element into collection
* Pop: remove the most recently added elements

### Queue

Fist in First out. Linkedlist can be used as an implementation

### Hash table
