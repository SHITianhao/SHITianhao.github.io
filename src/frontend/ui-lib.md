# React UI Framework

Lots of front-end developer build the UI over and over again. Most of them have no functional differences. And some big companies as well as the open source communities have recognized the great advantages of having their own UI toolkits and encapsulated the design patterns in modular standardized units, the **UI Components**

### [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)

The Material Design is the first design language that I learned, since I am a big fans of Android. Unfortunately Google did't provide an official UI framework in React echosystem since they want sell their Angular. That is how the open source project, [Material UI]([http://www.material-ui.com/#/), so important. It provides re-usable React components that implement Google's Material Design and greatful documents.

After using this library for several months, I met lots of problem with data visulization. Material Design was borned for end-consumers on mobile devices, so that the usage frequence was considered to pretty low. Furthermore, the number of the data-originated components is really poor :(

### [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)

Ant Design is an UI design language developed by Alibaba. It is designed for enterprise production. It provides lots of powerful re-usable UI components, such as Table including pagination, sorting, filting and sub title. My favorate part is the **Tree Components**, it can be used as visulization of Folder or Orgnization Structure! 

Plus! It is implemented in **Typescript** ;)

### [Blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)

Developed and implemented by Palantir, should be a great UI library for data visualization. It is developed in TypeScript and well documented. But personally never tried it in any project yet.
