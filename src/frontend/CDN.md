# CDN

Content Delivery Network. It is a distributed system that deliver the static web resource to a user, based on **Geolocation** of the user. For example,  a user is visiting Netflix and wants to play the last episode of Black Mirror. Instead of downloading the streaming from the Netflix server in US, the request will be done through a local PoPs (points of presence) based on user's geolocation. This is much faster than sending the request all around the world and waiting the response back.
